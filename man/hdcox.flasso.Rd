\title{Fused Lasso Model Selection for High-Dimensional Cox Models}
\usage{
hdcox.flasso(x, y, nfolds = 5L, seed = 1001, trace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data matrix.}

\item{y}{Response matrix made by \code{\link[survival]{Surv}}.}

\item{nfolds}{Fold numbers of cross-validation.}

\item{seed}{A random seed for cross-validation fold division.}

\item{trace}{Output the cross-validation parameter tuning
progress or not. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
Automatic fused lasso model selection for high-dimensional
Cox models, evaluated by penalized partial-likelihood.
}
\note{
The cross-validation procedure used in this function is the
so-called approximated cross-validation provided by the \code{penalized}
package. Be careful dealing with the results since they might be more
optimistic than fully fitting the model. This cross-validation method
is more suitable for datasets with larger number of observations,
and a higher number of cross-validation folds.

# Load imputed SMART data; only use the first 120 samples
